# Design Patterns
A design patterns is general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring software problem.  A design patterns is not a finished specification that can be transformed directly into code. instead it is template for solving a particular problem.  Thinking in terms of design patterns allows you to formulate a high-level solutation that is independent of the implementation details.  using established design patterns lead to a solution that is easily understandable, testeble, and maintainable.


# What is S.O.L.I.D ?
S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five Object Oriented Design Principles

S - Single Responsibility Principle

O - Open Closed Principle

L - Liskov Substitution Principle

I - Interface Segregation Prinicple

D - Dependency Inversion Principle

When these 5 principle are applied to software development, it makes it easy to develop software that follows good architecture and is easy to maintain and extend.

# Gang of Four Design Patterns  
[Ref YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU_1StN5Tkk)

there are 23 design patterns authored by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides knows as Gang of Four Design Patterns.
GoF Design Patterns are caregories in 3 categories, Cerational Patterns, Structural Patterns and Behavioral Patterns
